# Clutchness-Analysis
In this analysis we use a SQL ite to analyze a database consisting of multiple tables that track NFL data across the period of 2004-2019. The purpose of this analysis is to see if Tom Brady really is the most clutch Quarterback given the data within the data base.
The data can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present?select=combine.csv

Note: To run this notebook first download the data from kaggle and save the CSVs to a file entitled "nfl", you can then run the code within the notebook to turn this into a SQLite database and run the code from there.
