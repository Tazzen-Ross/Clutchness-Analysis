# Clutchness-Analysis
In this analysis we use a SQL ite to analyze a database consisting of multiple tables that track NFL data across the period of 2004-2019. The purpose of this analysis is to see if Tom Brady really is the most clutch Quarterback given the data within the data base.
The data can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present?select=combine.csv
